# Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

## Required

üéØ What requirements did you achieve?

    - Creating a client using React.
    - Using Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.

    -Building a React form for users to create posts. - Create multiple pages using React Router.

    -Designing a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data. - Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.

    -Displaying all posts using .map().
    -using react router dom to cretae dynamic pages
    -creating dedicated routes /book/:bookId

    -managed to add adelete button and it works well now , previosuly i had setup the query in the server.

-Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

    -i wanted to create a create a dedicated route for when user clicks on the book title it takes one to a page that contains its details along with filtered user comments showing only  comments of the book as well as having the user form there.

    -i have added additional sql queries in the server and i had tested them using postman they are all working well , i was to use them in the client side but for now i haven't used all of them. i wish to continue with this project later on and to have it fully functional as i had intended.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

    -what i found most difficult were the dynamic routes and nested routes.

## Optional

üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

- Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

  when having issues i would go back and watch the specific video on that topic from class and go through the demo codes a lot in regards to what i am tackling.

  -https://youtu.be/jWWW9Wyl0mY?si=NSSCaA6OZeTDKTnN
  to understand how to delete using .filter

- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

  when trying to have a dedicated route /book/:bookId the book details jsx i saved a simple message but it wasn't showing
  when i went to that page after clcking the link . it was when i moved the route to section.jsx along with where the routes to about, contact and books are did that work.

- What went really well and what could have gone better?

  form validation and fetching the data. i have a good understanding of it now and what could have gone better if i were to be able to add update forms and adding additional queries.
