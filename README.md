## Required

üéØ What requirements did you achieve?

    - Creating a client using React.
    - Using Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.

    -Building a React form for users to create posts. - Create multiple pages using React Router.

    -Designing a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data. - Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.

    -Displaying all posts using .map().

-Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

    -i wanted to create a create a dedicated route for when user clicks on the book title it takes one to a page that contains its details along with filtered user comments showing only  comments of the book as well as having the user form there.

    -i have added additional sql queries in the server and i had tested them using postman they are all working well , i was to use them in the client side but for now i haven't used all of them. i wish to continue with this project later on and to have it fully functional as i had intended.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

    -what i found most difficult were the dynamic routes and nested routes.
